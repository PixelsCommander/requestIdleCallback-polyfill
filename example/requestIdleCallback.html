        <h1>This is a basic demo for reqestIdleCalback polyfill</h1>

        requestIdleCallback is a new browser API which allows to execute code when browser is idle.
        This is crucial for creating smooth animations and user experiences allowing to avoid janks which basically happens
        when CPU become overloaded to fit into frame budget which is 16 msec.

        <h2>How polyfill works</h2>

        Polyfill is built on principe that janks are most harmful to UX and janks have highest chance to happen when user is
        continously interacting with UI. Polyfill basically prevents operation from being executed while user performing some
        actions on interface. Currently this implies scrolls, taps, clicks, mouse and touch movements. The condition is pretty
        simple - if there were no interactions for 100 msec there is a huge chance that we are in idle.

        TODO Consider touchend, touchcancel, mouseup, touchleave for faster idle recognition.
        TODO Consider CSS transitions as blockers via listening to transitionstart, transitionend.
